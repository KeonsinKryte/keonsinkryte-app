                        Learning electronics it‚Äôs a very complex and quite boring activity. It‚Äôs necessary understand natural phenomena and apply math in many cases. For a kid this have to be a big nightmare. That‚Äôs why in 418 Media Lab we wanted to tackle this problem, and create a way where kids can learn electronics without dying of boredom <span>ü•±</span> or exploding their minds <span>ü§Ø</span> trying to learn how to create from scratch a lunar rover.

                        What I learned?: There‚Äôs something special when you work for a community. The kids enjoying something that you‚Äôve created for them, the gratitude that we received and the satisfaction for creating a tool for learning an essential cultural topic.

                        One of the greatest lessons I learned through this project, was the ability to get insights from an unknown culture, everything was new for me; the language, the meaning of nature, the relationship with the soil, the social hierarchy and the resilience of whole community.

                        Another great lesson was the ability to create from the inevitable ‚Äúclash of cultures‚Äù between two different world interpretations.

                        It‚Äôs important to understand your user and provide them with tools that mold into the cultural stamp and do not allow our cosmology prevail over theirs.
