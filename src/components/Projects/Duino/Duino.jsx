For a kid this have to be a big nightmare.

                                I‚Äôve never thought how many variables are necessary to accomplish some basic tasks or even design a pattern for a circuit (Easy if you use a regular breadboard and wire circuit).

                                It‚Äôs gratifying as designers to see how our products are used, but this time it‚Äôs going to take more time that we expected. I wait that moment with so much hype.
