                                There‚Äôs something special when you work for a community. The kids enjoying something that you‚Äôve created for them, the gratitude that we received and the satisfaction for creating a tool for learning an essential cultural topic.

                                One of the greatest lessons I learned through this project, was the ability to get insights from an unknown culture, everything was new for me; the language, the meaning of nature, the relationship with the soil, the social hierarchy and the resilience of a whole community.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Another great lesson was the ability to create from the inevitable ‚Äúclash of cultures‚Äù between two different world interpretations.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                It‚Äôs important to understand your user and provide them with tools that mold into the cultural stamp and do not allow our cosmology prevail over theirs.
