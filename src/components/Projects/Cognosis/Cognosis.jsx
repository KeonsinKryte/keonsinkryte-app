                            As many of you will already know, Parkinson‚Äôs is a neurodegenerative disease. In other words, the disease damages the brain progressively and generating a series of motor, non-motor, cognitive and psychological symptoms.

                            Being such a large and massive disease, we decided to focus mainly on cognitive symptom, such as: loss of orientation, short-term memory loss, recognition failure and among others that affects patient‚Äôs daily life.

                            <br />
                            By this precept, different medical organizations have created specific tools for diagnostics of multiple symptoms to ensure the correct measurement and precise treatment such as PD-CFRS, PD-NMS Q, Yesavage, MD-PQRS, MoCA, among others.
